-- For my setup, when the number of monitors == 1, it's likely that I'm either
-- using the battery and not my external mouse, or that I'm using the computer
-- just far enough from my desk (watching TV, most likely) that the mouse is
-- barely in range and drains it's battery trying to stay connected... so...
-- we turn it off when I drop to one monitor.  I can always toggle it back (see
-- _keys).
